This is a write-up for shop under the reverse engineering category available at:
https://play.picoctf.org/login?redirect=/practice/challenge/134

Downloading the file and making it executable with:
```
wget <link>
chmod +x source
```
From running the executable I gathered that:
1. I can buy/sell items
2. I have 40 coins
3. Item number 3's name is Fruitful Flag (100 coins) which is peculiar so if I buy that I might get the flag perhaps

First lets try to mess with the binary with all the wrong inputs trying to break it.

I tried buying negative amount of item 1 and I gained coin. Which means now I can buy the flag item. Buying the flag gives an ASCII output which after concatenating the values you get the flag.

Well that was dumb. Let's do this the fun way!

I will use gdb and try to get the flag assuming that this software got patched and I cant break it that easily.

```
gdb source
(gdb) disass main
> Function "main" not defined.
```
I tried to disassemble main but main is not defined so:

```
(gdb) info functions
> File /opt/hacksports/shared/staging/Shop_0_3803762289926176/problem_files/source.go:
void main.check(error);
void main.get_flag(void);
void main.main(void);
void main.menu([]main.item, []main.item, int, []main.item, []main.item, int);
void main.openShop(void);
void main.stockUp([]main.item, []main.item);
```
These are the functions in `source.go`.
The function `main.get_flag(void)` will most likely give us the flag.

So I'm going to start from `main.main` and see where its getting called so I just `jump` to that address see if I can skip having enough coins.

```
(gdb) disass main.main
> Dump of assembler code for function main.main:

0x080d3337 <+7>: mov -0x4(%ecx),%ecx
0x080d333d <+13>: cmp 0x8(%ecx),%esp

.

.

```
at 0x080d3342 <+18> we call `main.openShop`
```
(gdb) disass main.openShop
```
`openShop` calls `main.stockUp` and `main.menu`. `stockUp` doesn't sound relevant so lets focus on menu.
```
(gdb) disass main.menu

0x080d3ebf <+1375>: mov %ebp,0x24(%esp)
0x080d3ec3 <+1379>: call 0x80d4440 <main.get_flag>
0x080d3ec8 <+1384>: mov 0xa8(%esp),%ecx
.
.
.
```
After reading through all of that at 0x080d3ec3 <+1379> we call the `main.get_flag` function.
So let's put a `breakpoint` at `main.menu` and then `jump` to the flag function.
```
(gdb) b main.menu
> Breakpoint 2 at 0x80d3960
(gdb) run

(gdb) jump *0x080d3ec3

```
And here we go! If the solution is boring look for a better one!
